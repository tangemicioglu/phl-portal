## Connecting Gloves

The PHL gloves connect to your tablet Bluetooth, similarly to how wireless headphones do. Once you log into the web app, you will be able to connect your gloves to your tablet by pressing the "Connect to Gloves" button shown below. Here, you should see the gloves pop up as an available device. Clicking on the name should then connect your gloves to your tablet. Note if you've connected your gloves to the tablet before this popup might not appear. This display should now say "Gloves Connected" 

## Starting Session

Press the "Start Passive Session" button, enter the duration of the practice, what lessons to be played, and the frequency for each lesson. Then start the session. It may take a few seconds for the gloves to turn on and begin playing. 

## During Session

- Progress through the song should appear on the left glove
- If the left glove flashes red lights that means it has been disconnected from the right glove
